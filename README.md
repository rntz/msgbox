# What is msgbox?

msgbox is a distributed push-notification system that persists notifications to
disk so that you can receive notifications the next time you connect if you
happen to be offline when they happen.

It could also be used as the basis for, say, a distributed TODO-list. TODO:
explain how.

That's what it's supposed to be, anyway. It's not finished yet.

# How does it work?
